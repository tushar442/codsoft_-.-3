**Project Title:** Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Overview:**
This project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset was highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases compared to legitimate transactions. The goal was to build a model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, using logistic regression as the primary algorithm.

**Objectives:**
- To analyze and preprocess the credit card fraud detection dataset.
- To handle imbalanced data and ensure accurate fraud detection.
- To build and evaluate a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Used **Pandas** for analyzing the dataset and understanding the distribution of legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions.
   - Visualized data patterns and relationships between variables using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled the highly imbalanced dataset by using techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
   - Standardized the feature scaling to ensure better model performance.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - Focused on reducing false positives to avoid flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression (from Scikit-learn)

**Outcome:**
The logistic regression model successfully detected fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, while carefully managing false positives. This project enhanced my understanding of imbalanced datasets, model evaluation, and fraud detection techniques in real-world applications.
